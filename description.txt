The journey to the mystic nature is my first mod.

It adds a few things about plant items.

This mod adds:

- 58 new items, most of them being new weapons and armor options
- 4 new resource families
- 3 new enemies, which are worthy to kill for more materials
- 11 new tiles, some to decorate your buildings and other to mine new resources
- More to be added soon!

If you don't understand how to do something or how to start with the mod, check the change notes of the steam workshop page.

Thank you for playing!
